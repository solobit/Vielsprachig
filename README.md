# Vielsprachig

This is a little data format polyglot I quickly mashed up for fun and profit. It contains a collection of to/from JSON compilable data format languages, currently:

## Packaging

### Git Submodules

Not every project on GitHub is Node.js, or is but non-compliant to standards (e.g. missing package.json) so we just `git submodule` those.

* TOML

### registry.npmjs.org

* JSON
* CSON
* YAML
* XML
* HTML
* CSV

Check `package.json` for the exact project names.

## Installation

### Bootstrapped (setup script)

A simple as just running `bootstrap`

```sh
git clone https://github.com/solobit/Vielsprachig && cd Vielsprachig
sh bootstrap.sh
```

Always check any (`+x` executable) scripts source code before you execute.
Never run these as `root` without careful consideration.

### Manual installation

The `bootstrap` file is just a `.sh` executable script with two commands
chained conditionally:

```sh`
npm install && git submodule update --init
```

This downloads the `node_modules` from the npmjs.org referenced git(hub)
repositories as per dependencies specified in `package.json`. Only if that
succeeds, do a `git submodule` update and initialise the repositories which are
not served by node.js package manager. This clones any missing submodules and
checks out the commit specified in the index as a detached `HEAD`.
